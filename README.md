# Matchbox-RGB-V2
Control board for RGB LED strips, based on ESP8266 platform. Powered by DC jack and controlled by Wi-Fi. Option to connect an external IR receiver for additional IR remote control support.
Unfinished project at the stage of finished design which should work. However, the board was never manufactured.

### Programming using the external programmer [F_Board](https://github.com/DaiveeCZ/F_Board-V1.1) which I also designed and was successfully built.

## CAUTION: Board can work with 5V or 12V RGB LED stripes. BUT if you connect to the 12V power input and connect a 5V LED strip you will blow it up!!

## Pin map:
- 1 - R
- 2 - G
- 3 - B
- 4 - IR (for external IR receiver)
- 5 - 5/12V
- 6 - GND
